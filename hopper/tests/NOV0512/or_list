For this week, please note:

Priority Definitions
---------------------------------
- 4 for constrained observations that absolutely must be done in this load
- 5 for time constrained or otherwise urgent targets that should be done in this load if at all possible
- 6 for objects from the LTS without time constraints 

Comments
---------------------------------
Obsid 14221 and 15580: Pictor A Jet (37ks and 12ks) Roll preference of 345 +/- 55
      degrees. +180 is not ok. Midweek roll is 36.471 +/- 10 so this
      preference can be met all week. However, if this observation is
      scheduled at the beginning of the week an off nominal roll
      angle will be required.
      Uninterrupt request.
Obsid 13871: NGC 3341 (50ks) Target goes into moon block starting from
      DOY 311 and ending DOY 317. Please schedule at the beginning of the
      week or at the end of the week.  
Obsid 13963: RXJ1131-1231 (15ks) Target is in sun block the beginning
      of the week, please schedule after DOY 310. 
      Monitoring constraint follows Obsid 13962 by 180-270 days, met
      all week.
      Uninterrupt request.
Obsid 14000: G12-34 (15ks) Needs a stable focal plane.

respectively. These observations are all scheduled for the same week
so there is no need for approval.

Remarks:
The existing observations show that Pic A's jet is variable on timescales of 
years. Only a long-term project can constrain the properties of the variable 
emission regions on these timescales, and so we have requested a MCOP. We would 
prefer these observations to be scheduled as two blocks of 50 ks each, spaced 
by a timescale of the order of months in each of the three years of the 
program. Detailed timings are not critical to the science.
